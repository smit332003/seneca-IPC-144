I got to many errors when I was defining initially but after going through some errors and previous instructions, I got my output. Moreover, I also faced problem in structuring below code initially before starting. For example, in selection of loop in below given code I was bit confused but after figuring out and going through previous workshop codes, I got final solution. Example:char inputCharOption (const char *charCorrect){    char valueChar;    int i=0;       for(i=0;charCorrect[i] != '\0';i++){           scanf("%c",&valueChar);            if(valueChar == charCorrect[i]){               break;            }            else{                printf("ERROR: Character must be one of [%s]: ",charCorrect);                clearInputBuffer();            }       }    return valueChar;Answer 2:Main difference in assigning 0 and Null is that null define as there is no values in it. It calls empty shell. Whereas 0 is value itself. For example, if we add value NULL in one particular shall then the value of the given shell is nothing, I mean the value of that shell is empty. On the other side, if we add value of given shell 0 then it means that given shall is not empty but value of shell itself is 0 (zero).

Example:

	
int i = 0, count = 0;

    if (phoneNumber == NULL)
    {
        printf("(___)___-____");
    }

    else {
        for (i = 0; phoneNumber[i] != '\0'; i++) {
            if (phoneNumber[i] >= '0' && phoneNumber[i] <= '9') {
                count++;
            }
        }
Answer 3:

if one of my friend facing problem in understanding what is standard input buffer and even after going through all notes and lectures then I would like to illustrate about buffer is basically storage for input and output.So buffer takes particular input and send out for output and to take another input in then it should be cleared first.so i take time and give all information about it and it may help my friend to understand.
