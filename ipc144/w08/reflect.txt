There are two different ways In order to pass information from struct to function.
â€“: we can do that just by passing all elements to the function and other way is that we can able to do by passing the whole struct from the function


If we pass the struct "displayReportData" to function just by passing through the address and all the members in the struct can be accessed through  (.).
struct CatFoodInfo getCatFoodInfo(const int seq_num) {
   struct CatFoodInfo Product = { 0 };
   printf("\nCat Food Product #%d\n", seq_num + 1);
   printf("--------------------\n");
   printf("SKU           : ");
   getIntPositive(&Product.SKUnumber);
   printf("PRICE         : $");
   getDoublePositive(&Product.productPRZ);
   printf("WEIGHT (LBS)  : ");
   getDoublePositive(&Product.productWGHT);
   printf("CALORIES/SERV.: ");
   getIntPositive(&Product.productCAL);


   return Product;
}


Using struct with address can use less amount of the memory.

We are able to avoid writing the same members again by writing nested structs instead of repeating it.
Here i am giving example of it.
struct ReportData
{
   int productskunumber;
   double pricepro;
   int caloriesofproduct;
   double weightlb;
   double inkgs;
   int wghtgrams;
   double totalserves;
   double costserves;
   double costpercalperserve;
};
