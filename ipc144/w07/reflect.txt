Q1) Describe the benefits and advantages of using user-defined types (structures) in this workshop. You must explain your answer using an example from this workshop.


Ans: With the use of Structs, variables with various data-types can be stored in a single "mega-variable" which is very convenient when compared with arrays.
         For example:- 
        struct GameInfo
{
   int N_moves;
   int N_positions;
   int bombs[maxpathlength];
   int treasure[maxpathlength];
};


        can be used instead of using multiple arrays which saves .


Q2) If we enhanced this workshop to keep a history of games played including the endgame results, briefly describe what two major logical changes you would have to make to your program to make this possible?


Ans: it is possible just by adding int variables for saving previous game sessions and some other variables like char for players symbole. These two changes can make it possible. 


Q3) What part of this workshop did you spend the most time working on? What did you do to overcome your difficulties?


Ans: in this part 2 workshop 7 i spent most time while putting input of bombs and treasures, i got so many errors in output but somehow i manage to get it done. Secondly in displaying players progress i found some minor errors.
